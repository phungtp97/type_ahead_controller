        content:
        'A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old. The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. The roots of a tree are usually under the ground. The trunk is the main body of the tree. The branches of a tree are the parts that grow out from the trunk. The leaves of a tree are green and use sunlight to make food through a process called photosynthesis. The inside of a tree trunk is made of many rings. The rings can tell us how old the tree is and what the weather was like during each year of the tree’s life.',

        'The dog is one of the most popular pets in the world. It ordinarily is a carnivorous canid, eats meat, and has been domesticated for at least 14,000 years. The dog was the first domesticated animal and has been the most widely kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human history. The domestic dog is a domesticated form of the gray wolf. The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.',
